Hii! Welcome to my professional portfolio. I am Hardik Tankaria, a dedicated researcher with a Ph.D. in Continuous Optimization from [Kyoto University](https://www.kyoto-u.ac.jp/en), Japan, and a master degree from [IIT Hyderabad](https://www.iith.ac.in/). Recently, I served as research associate in [IIT Mandi](https://www.iitmandi.ac.in/), contributing large-scale optimization with federated learning. With over six years of specialized experience, my work is to develop large-scale optimization techniques and solve complex optimization challenges in machine learning and in deep learning.

I am looking for a challenging role as a [Data Scientist or Machine Learning Engineer] that allows me to apply my strong background in innovating and solving complex real-world problems within data-driven industries. I want to work on impactful projects that leverage data to create significant value.

# Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

# Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

# Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
