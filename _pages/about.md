Hii! Welcome to my professional portfolio. I am Hardik Tankaria, a dedicated researcher with a Ph.D. in Continuous Optimization from [Kyoto University](https://www.kyoto-u.ac.jp/en), Japan, and a master degree from [IIT Hyderabad](https://www.iith.ac.in/). Recently, I served as research associate in [IIT Mandi](https://www.iitmandi.ac.in/), contributing large-scale optimization with federated learning. With over six years of specialized experience, my work is to develop large-scale optimization techniques and solve complex optimization challenges in machine learning and in deep learning.

I am looking for a challenging role as a [Data Scientist or Machine Learning Engineer] that allows me to apply my strong background in innovating and solving complex real-world problems within data-driven industries. I want to work on impactful projects that leverage data to create significant value.
