  abstract={The limited memory BFGS (L-BFGS) method is one of the popular methods for solving large-scale unconstrained optimization.
  Since the standard L-BFGS method uses a line search to guarantee its global convergence, it sometimes requires a large number of function
  evaluations. To overcome the difficulty, we propose a new L-BFGS with a certain regularization technique. We show its global convergence
  under the usual assumptions. In order to make the method more robust and efficient, we also extend it with several techniques such as
  the nonmonotone technique and simultaneous use of the Wolfe line search. Finally, we present some numerical results for test problems
  in CUTEst, which show that the proposed method is robust in terms of solving more problems.}

  abstract={The quasi-Newton methods generally provide curvature information by approximating the Hessian using the secant
  equation. However, the secant equation becomes insipid in approximating the Newton step owing to its use of the first-order
  derivatives. In this study, we propose an approximate Newton step-based stochastic optimization algorithm for large-scale
  empirical risk minimization of convex functions with linear convergence rates. Specifically, we compute a partial column
  Hessian of size (d×k) with k $<$d randomly selected variables, then use the \textit{Nyström method} to better approximate the
  full Hessian matrix. To further reduce the computational complexity per iteration, we directly compute the update step ($\delta$w)
  without computing and storing the full Hessian or its inverse. Furthermore, to address large-scale scenarios in which even
  computing a partial Hessian may require significant time, we used distribution-preserving (DP) sub-sampling to compute a
  partial Hessian. The DP sub-sampling generates p sub-samples with similar first and second-order distribution statistics and
  selects a single sub-sample at each epoch in a round-robin manner to compute the partial Hessian. We integrate our
  approximated Hessian with stochastic gradient descent and stochastic variance-reduced gradients to solve the logistic
  regression problem. The numerical experiments show that the proposed approach was able to obtain a better approximation of
  Newton\textquotesingle s method with performance competitive with the state-of-the-art first-order and the stochastic
  quasi-Newton methods.}

  abstract={In this paper, we consider to improve the stochastic variance reduce gradient (SVRG) method via incorporating
  the curvature information of the objective function. We propose to reduce the variance of stochastic gradients using the
  computationally efficient Barzilai-Borwein (BB) method by incorporating it into the SVRG. We also incorporate a BB-step
  size as its variant. We prove its linear convergence theorem that works not only for the proposed method but also for the
  other existing variants of SVRG with second-order information. We conduct the numerical experiments on the benchmark datasets
  and show that the proposed method with constant step size performs better than the existing variance reduced methods for some
  test problems.}

  abstract={We propose a quasi-Newton type regularized Nyström method for solving unconstrained large scale non-convex
  optimization problem with high-dimensional feature spaces. We focus on l2-regularized objective function. To efficiently
  approximate the Hessian, we employ a regularized Nystrom method to approximate Hessian. However, the Hessian of non-convex
  function may produce negative eigenvalues. We confront the issue of negative eigenvalue via incorporating the regularized
  parameter to obtain positive definite matrix and the descent direction, resulting in to the regulazied fixed-rank Nystrom
  approximation. This fixed-rank approximation offers flexibility in rank selection through random column sampling,
  enhancing computational efficiency. Complementing this, we employ backtracking line search to ascertain suitable step
  sizes, utilizing partial Hessian information to approximate the full Hessian matrix. We establish global convergence under
  standard assumptions and provide a comprehensive analysis of the global complexity. Finally, we demonstrate numerical
  experiments to show the robustness and efficiency of the proposed method by comparing it with existing methods.}

  abstract={This master's thesis covers the Hasse–Minkowski theorem, a central theorem in number theory.
  The theorem states that two quadratic forms over a number field are equivalent if and only if they are equivalent
  at all completions of the number field. The paper looks into the proof of this theorem, in relation to quadratic forms
  over the rationals. It addresses the local-global principle when exploring equivalence, emphasizing the relationship
  between local properties at different places (like real and p-adic completions) and global properties over the rationals.
  The thesis reinforces what we understand about quadratic forms, and illustrates how the Hasse–Minkowski principle and
  theorem relate to algebraic number theory as a whole.}

  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
